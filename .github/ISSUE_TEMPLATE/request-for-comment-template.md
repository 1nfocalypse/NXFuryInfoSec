**Problem:**
Give a 1-2 sentence description of a problem with the current NXFury Curriculum. Please be as specific as possible when addressing problems! Successful critiques of the curriculum will point out ways that NXFury is failing to uphold our mission statement detailed in the README. Examples are:

* NXFury does not list a course covering X topic we said we would cover at Y.
* NXFury lists courses X, Y and Z that cover the same topics when fewer courses could suffice.
* NXFury recommends course X to teach a topic, but there exists a higher quality course that covers the same material and meets our specifications.

**Proposed Solution**
Please offer a proposed solution to the problem, and if necessary, elaborate upon it further here.
You may also link to a pull request here.

**Alternatives**
Please provide some alternatives here if applicable for ease of communication.
